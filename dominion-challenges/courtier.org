* coutier: better to get +3 now, or gain a gold
** variables:
*** how many more provinces can you get by adding 3 now
*** how many more provinces can you get by adding a gold
**** estimated turns to end
**** average chance of opponents getting province
**** deck size
***** turnaround (how quickly you get to use)
** simulate game
*** lasts provinceNumber  modified by chance to get province
**** chance to get province increases slowly as game goes on

     #+begin_src js
       let chanceToGetProvince = (turn) {
  
       }
     #+end_src

*** average gold per turn as a function of the turn number ( more average gold as turns go on )
** simplify question
*** given turns left in game, and deck size,  which gives you more money


#+begin_src js
  const moneyOrGold = (turnsLeft, deckSize) {
    const cycle = deckSize / 5;
    const goldVal = 3;
    let wealthAddOfGold = turnsLeft / cycle * goldVal;
    
    return wealthAddOfGold > 3 ? "gold" : "+3"
